"""
Tests desired behavior of using two HTTPRoutes declaring the same hostname using both AuthPolicy and RateLimitPolicy.
https://github.com/Kuadrant/kuadrant-operator/blob/main/doc/auth.md#limitation-multiple-network-resources-with-identical-hostnames
https://github.com/Kuadrant/kuadrant-operator/blob/main/doc/rate-limiting.md#limitation-multiple-network-resources-with-identical-hostnames
(see the first topology mentioned in both links).
For AuthPolicy, the test should start passing once the policy-2 is enforced on route-b
For RateLimitPolicy (RLP) the test should start passing once the policy-1 is effectively enforced on route-a
