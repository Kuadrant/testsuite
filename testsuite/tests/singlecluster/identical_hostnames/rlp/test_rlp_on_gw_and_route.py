    Tests that Gateway-attached RateLimitPolicy is ignored on 'route2' if both 'route' and 'route2' declare

        - Empty RateLimitPolicy enforced on the '/anything/route1' HTTPRoute

        - Send a request via 'route' and assert that no 429s (Too Many Requests) are returned
        - Send a request via 'route2' and assert that no 429s (Too Many Requests)are returned
        - Delete the Empty RateLimitPolicy
